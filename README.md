# Predicting-Molecular-Properties

Molecular property called as **scalar coupling constant** is to be predicted from some geometric features of 100,000 plus organic molecules.

## Running scripts

Run the load_data.R script to first load the data the way we want and then use the analysis.R script to run the code for modeling

## Data
The datasets are huge so, they have to be downloaded from kaggle

train.csv, test.csv, and structures.csv files should be downloaded from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/data)

geometric features should be downloaded from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/bigironsphere/simple-molecular-geometry-features)

### NOTE: This scripts are not very organized and are still in progress
